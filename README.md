# GDPTableau

The representation of data is a powerful way to form a conclusion about a certain idea. Thus, it is important that the visualization of the data is done in an efficient, elegant, and meaningful way. The objective of this project is to visualize the trends in racial diversity in the United States, and then determine whether these trends correlate or show causation to another variable relevant to the United States. In todayâ€™s highly polarized political landscape, there is often talk of the positive or negative effects immigration and/or increasing racial diversity has on an area. For this reason, we decided to choose gross domestic product (GDP) to be our variable, as it is a measure of economic activity. Tableau is used to analyze and visualize our data in order to answer our question. The datasets used each span 28 years, from 1990-2018, and forecasting, a tool in Tableau that uses exponential smoothing models, is used to estimate the projected growth of both racial diversity and GDP over the next 10 years.
